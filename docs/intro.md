# Introduction

Deploy Local â€” is a command line interface designed to help developers quickly deploy projects to their local machine.

DL is a wrapper on top of Docker and docker-compose, no additional software or libraries are required to install.

Supported OS:
- Linux (debian, ubuntu, linux mint, etc)
- macOS
- Windows (via WSL2)

Supported frameworks and CMS:
- Bitrix
- Laravel
- WordPress

Dependencies:
- docker
- docker-compose

## Features
- Support for PHP versions (apache and php-fpm) 7.3, 7.4, 8.0
- Support for MySQL versions 5.7, 8.0
- Downloading the database and files from the production server
- Redis
- Memcached
- Nginx
- Cross-platform
- Interception of mail sent via php
- Portainer - docker container management system
- Does not require root access
- Accessing sites from the browser via `.localhost` or` .nip.io`

## How it works?
After installing the utility, 3 service docker containers will be launched on your computer:
- Traefik (proxy server for interacting with installed projects)
- Mailhog (lightweight service for intercepting emails sent from a local site)
- and Portainer (a web interface for working with Docker)

Sites that you run through DL are in their own virtual network, you can run several projects at the same time, each will have its own URL.
When the project starts, all the source code (in the directory where DL is launched) is mounted in a docker container, which allows you to edit the code and immediately test the functionality in the browser.

Using the variables in the `.env` file, you can set the necessary settings that are required for a specific project, as well as completely redefine the startup images for your own. For ease of launch (and modification) the file `docker-compose.yaml` is used.
