- Portainer - docker container management system
- Does not require root access
- Accessing sites from the browser via `.localhost` or` .nip.io`
- Ability to add custom docker-compose.yaml files to DL configuration

## How it works?
After installing the utility, 3 service docker containers will be launched on your computer:
- Traefik (proxy server for interacting with installed projects)
- Mailhog (lightweight service for intercepting emails sent from a local site)
- and Portainer (a web interface for working with Docker)

Sites that you run through DL are in their own virtual network, you can run several projects at the same time, each will have its own URL.
When the project starts, all the source code (in the directory where DL is launched) is mounted in a docker container, which allows you to edit the code and immediately test the functionality in the browser.

Using the variables in the `.env` file, you can set the necessary settings that are required for a specific project, as well as add or completely override the launched images to your own. For ease of launch (and modification) the file `docker-compose.yaml` is used.
